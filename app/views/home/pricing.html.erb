<legend>Pricing Calculation</legend>
<p>
	We don't have any fixed formula for calculating price of a patch. Whenever we receive a sample design from our customer we get feedback from our production unit and then send the price quote to our customer. Following are the factors which impact pricing:
	<ul>
		<li>Sample Design Provided</li>
		<li>Size of the Patch required</li>
		<li>Quantity requested</li>
		<li>Backing of the Patch</li>
	</ul>
	Please use <%= link_to "Free Quote", newquote_url%> to get an estimate for your patch.
</p>

<legend>High Quality at Low Prices</legend>

<legend>Free Desing Services</legend>
<p>
	We provide our customers free design services. We've been helping our customers to improve their existing design or suggest design from our experience.  
</p>
  
<legend>Backing of patch</legend>
<p>
	Normally there is no pricing attached with the backing of the patch, but if customer want a special backing for the patch then there might be some additional cost attached to that.
